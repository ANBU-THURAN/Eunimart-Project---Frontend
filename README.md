# Online Shopping Store
This is a web application for an online shopping store built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to login and view a list of products, which can be clicked to view more details on a separate page. The data for the products is obtained from a public API. The application also features a logout button that clears the user's information from local storage and redirects them back to the login page.

# Getting Started
To use this application, simply clone the repository to your local machine and open the **"loginpage.html"** file in your web browser. You will be directed to the login page where you can enter your name, phone number, and email to proceed to the homepage. From there, you can view the list of products and click on each item to view more details.

# API
This application uses the Fake Store API to obtain data for the products. The API provides a range of product categories and details such as title, price, description, and image.
